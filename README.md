# Helminth Bioinformatics (Asia) (Virtual)
Practical hands-on training in helminth genome analysis.

## Course overview
Helminths infections contribute significantly to the burden of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in many low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). Despite important efforts to tackle these diseases through mass drug administration programs and other methods of control and containment, NTDs due to helminths such as schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases continue to be among the most debilitating and morbidity-causing diseases in LMICs adding significantly to the economic burden in the strained economies. Moreover, decreased susceptibility to the most used chemotherapies is emerging in the field, raising concerns about the rise of drug-resistant helminths.

Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the production of draft and high-quality genome assemblies for the most important disease-causing helminths. In addition, reduced costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques make sequencing accessible to the wider scientific community of researchers and organisations, providing unprecedented access to genomics. Data manipulation and computational analyses are still the main challenges that limit the realization of maximum benefit and appropriate interpretation of these data.

The Helminth Bioinformatics course aims to equip participants with the skills needed to access, analyse and display large-scale genomic data. The course will provide hands-on training in read mapping, transcriptomics and genetic variation analysis, all tailored to address the challenges presented by large helminth genomes. Participants will acquire basic and advanced techniques in bioinformatics while getting familiar with computer command-line languages and public data repositories.

### Target audience
The programme is aimed at researchers at various levels including Senior Research Assistants, PhD Students, Postdoctoral Researchers, Laboratory Scientists and Clinical Scientists.

This week-long course is free to attend and open to applicants based in Asia involved in helminth-related research. The course will be taught in English.

### Prerequisites

The practical computational sessions will be taught exclusively through Unix/Linux. Participants should have some familiarity with the Linux operating system. This will allow participants to fully benefit from the course. There are numerous online introductory tutorials to the UNIX/Linux operating system and command line, including:
