## Overview and Aims <a name="intro"></a>
WormBase ParaSite is a specialist website that presents data on helminth genomics, gathering together nematode and flatworm genomes that have been assembled and annotated by the research community. Many of the analyses that you did in module 1 can be found pre-computed on WormBase ParaSite, making the data easily accessible in one website. In this module, weâ€™ll demonstrate the different ways that you can interact with WormBase ParaSite data and tools.
We will start by exploring the basic function of the website (part A); go on to examine two ways in which the WormBase ParaSite data can be queried for bulk access (part B); and end by exploring two popular tools in WormBase ParaSite: JBrowse and the Variant Effect Predictor (part C)

## Genes and Genomes  <a name="genes_and_genomes"></a>

## Looking at genes in WormBase ParaSite <a name="wbps_genes"></a>
In this first part of the module we will explore the basic functionality of the WormBase ParaSite website for looking at helminth genes and genomes.

### The Gene Page
The aim of this section is to familiarise you with retrieving information about a gene of interest from WormBase ParaSite. We will use a walk through example to illustrate how to use the website to find out about the function of an Opisthorcis viverrini gene.

#### Basic Navigation
