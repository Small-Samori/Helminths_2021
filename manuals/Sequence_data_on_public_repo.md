# Finding data on the web.

There is a lot of data already available on public repositories. These are fantastic resources to the scientific community and it is worth learning where to find it, how to search for it and how to download the data. 

In this section you will learn about two resources from the European Bioinformatics Institute, or EBI for short. These are the ENA (the European Nucleotide Archive) search page and ArrayExpress, a bespoke gene expression database. We will focus in obtaining data from genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing.

## ENA - European Nucleotide Archive

This is a very general database, equivalent to the NCBI main database search which you were introduced early in this course. Whether to use NCBI/SRA or EBI/ENA for obtaining sequencing data is a matter of personal interest. 

In the search boxes, one can enter any term. For example, try entering “Trichuris” and see what the results bring.
